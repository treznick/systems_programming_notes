use home email for contact/submission, not work email

for compilation:

clang++ -oW <executable name> -std=C++11 *.cpp
	- -o set an object file
	- -W shows all warnings
	- -std specifies the standard
	- *.cpp is a glob pattern that matches 'anything'.cpp

to redirect output to a file:

cin:	<
cout:	>
cerr:	2>

ls -al > <filename>

where > redirects the output of ls -al from stdout to a file

you can also redirect stderr using 2>

or both using &>

cout is buffered,

cerr is not

use cerr for error comments, use cout for output
